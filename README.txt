Unreal Engine v4.24.1

To Play navigate to Content->Prototype->Map and open "Prototype Map", when it is loaded click Play (I recommend you to use the "New Editor Window" Play option).

Controls: 	1-> Red Color
		2-> Green Color
		3-> Blue Color

Notice that to be able to pass through an obstacle you have to change while in movement, if you hit the obstacle and then change the color you will FAIL!
To restart game it you got stucked, just stop and play it again.
