# ReferencePrototypes
Repository created with the aim to hold all the different prototypes versions we are doing.

## Repo user guidelines

1- Master branch is not for development, only to hold most recent approved prototype version.
2- Each new prototype version must be hold to a new branch, with a proper name, starting with the number of the prototype iteration. 
	2.1-This branches will be where the development of the prototype in question will happen.
	2.2- If the branch is a prototype which is mostly based with another one, the prototype version has to be as follows: "[BasePrototype].[NewVersion] Branch Name" (i.e. 2.1. TurnRedone).
3- Each commit must have a clear name with a tag in the front which auto explain the purpose of the commit ([Update][New][Mechanic][LevelDesign]...).
4- When creating a branch always based with master branch by default (if the new branch is a prototype present in another branch can be an exception).
